\chapter{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Algorithm and characterization for top-m arm identification as a generalization of Russo's top-1 work.
  \item What is the relationship between the optimal allocation and the algorithm?
  $\rightarrow$ Mention the the outlook of proving convergence based on results
  we've established.
  \item Algorithm details/constraints:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item What are constraints on prior and posterior distributions?
    \item Are we in a frequentist or Bayesian setting?
    \item What is particular about the algorithm being Bayesian?
  \end{itemize}
  \item How do both statements translate to real world applications?
\end{itemize}
