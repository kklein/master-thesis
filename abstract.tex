  % 1 Top-m arm identification comprehensible for any scientist
  Top-$m$ arm identification revolves around identifying the set of $m$ best out
  of $k$ options with rewards following unknown probability distributions.
  % 2 Top-m arm identification comprehensible for scientist from the field
  In particular, for a fixed budget of samples, one seeks to increase confidence
  in the estimate. Conversely, for a fixed confidence, one seeks to require the
  least amount of samples possible. Hence the optimization revolves around a
  fast convergence rate of the confidence for increasing samples.
  %1 The problem addressed by this paper
  Our work seeks to characterize this optimality concept more explicitly and
  intuitively as well as provide an algorithm which is promising to converge to
  said optimality.
  % 1 Summary of main result
  Our characterization, relying on a definition of evidence, proves that the
  optimal allocation collects equal evidence to distinguish every pair of
  optimal and suboptimal arms.
  % 2 How the main result changes previous knowledge
  This characterization allows for a better intuitive understanding of the
  top-$m$ mechanism and should make it more convenient to prove convergence of
  algorithms. Being very simplistic to understand and implement, our algorithm
  comes with confidence estimates and allows for leveraging prior knowledge.
  %!1 Result in general context
  %2 Broader perspective, understandable by any scientist
  We hope that this work lays the foundation for top-$m$ convergence proofs, in
  particular for our suggested algorithm.
